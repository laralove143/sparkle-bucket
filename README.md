a [twilight](https://docs.rs/twilight) utility crate to limit users' usage

see [documentation](https://docs.rs/twilight-bucket/latest) for more info

this crate can be used with any library, but it shares twilight's non-goals, such as trying to be more verbose and less
opinionated and [serenity already has a bucket implementation][serenity bucket]
