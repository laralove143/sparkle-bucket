# Twilight Bucket
A utility crate to limit users' usage, a third party crate of the [Twilight ecosystem](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight)

Refer to the docs for more

This crate can be used with any library, but it shares Twilight's non-goals, such as trying to be more verbose and less
opinionated and [Serenity already has a bucket implementation](https://docs.rs/serenity/latest/serenity/framework/standard/buckets)
